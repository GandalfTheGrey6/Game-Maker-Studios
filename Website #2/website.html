        <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2> 
        <p id="tictoetext" style="display:inline"> This brand new inovation from Game Makers Studio is going to revolutionize the field of gaming. Tic-Tac-Toe is a game comprising of control and invasion of squares in a 3 by 3 grid. Players take turns 'capturing' unoccupied squares until one play has managaed to win by connecting two corners or opposite sides with their domain. This is a modern day, minimalistic version of chess and makes an excellent jumping off point for tactical real-time and turn based strategy games. This engaging gameplay is augmented by excellent graphics and noise direction. Advanced shaders are used to give the lines and boxes a distinct flatness and simplicity that looks next-gen compared to games like <i>Big Button</i> and <i>Rock, Paper, Scissors</i>. Audio is comprised of your opponent humming the Jeopardy Thinking Tune in your ear as you try and resist the urge to strangle them. <i>Tic-Tac-Toe</i> features a <p style="display:inline" id="gibberishgenerator"> </p></p>

    <h2 style="float: right;"> Rock, Paper, Scissors</h2> <br><br>
    <p> This engaging, thrilling, action-packed RPG, puts you in the shoes of a rock, a pair of scissors, or a sheet or paper. There are a lot of interesting builds involving paper grinding rock to gain more abilities like beating rock, tying against paper, and beating rock.<i>Rock, Paper, Scissors</i> explores the social reprocutions of a highly violent and predatory cast system. It transforms into a social deduction game played with friends. Players carefully explore their opponents choices and attempt to outwit and outmanouver them. Entirely textbased, this heralds back to the days of <i>Genesis</i> or <i>Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</i>.</p>
